myBDD is a light approach for embedded system's data storage, works as database but simpler to understand, only if you are familiar with console !
It works in te form of menus which makes the use of databases simpler because there is no need to know the commands.

* **OPEN** to open a database and read it or modify it
	* **CREATE** to create a table
